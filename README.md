# tabla_bol_recognition_MIR_Project
Course Project for Music Information Retrieval at UPF Barcelona 2018-19. \
Tabla bols were sampled from a dataset of Indian Tabla bols available at https://compmusic.upf.edu/tabla-solo-dataset \
Experiments were performed with different machine learning algorithms to train a classifier model to recognize the tabla bol using a variety of audio features extracted using Essentia library. \
Performance of around 72% classification accuracy was obtained using the HTK-MFCC features with an SVM classifier.

All the code is contained in the jupyter notebook MIR_Submission.ipynb \
All packages used in the code can be installed using pip3 install  \<package-name\>
